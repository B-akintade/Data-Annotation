# Data-Annotation for supervised learning
Built a binary classification dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product.
As a Product Owner, the goal of this project is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. I built a classification system that
• Can help flag serious cases
• Quickly identify healthy cases, and
• Generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors
Figure Eight's platform was used to create the data labelling job.
